# Calculator_QTgui

This is a simple calculator based on QT.

It works for as many operands as you want and the four basic mathematical operations: +-*/.

It's possible to work with the answer in its turn.

Current bugs:
Arithmetic handling
Decimal handling

Need to implement:
Paranthesis support


A unit test for the StringCalculator class would really be needed before anyone uses this calculator.
